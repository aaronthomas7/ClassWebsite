        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">I have just completed my first year few days back. So, I find myself standing at the perfect place to answer this question.

        First day, was really suspicious, don't knew who are going to be my roommates. 
        Group study is an illusion.
        Unlimited collection of television series, movies and many more will never make you feel bored.
        With the span of time, responsibility increases. Thus, stress also increases. And that time the memories you assemble now. Will be treasure to make you happy , in your loneliness. And one thing I'm sure that, the memories I gathered during my first year were very precious too me will make me smile at the tuff moments.
        P. S : college life memories are always awesome . But keeping adding up memories without hampering the actual motto.

        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">College fest is an annual cultural event at a college or university organized by the student community with the support of their Faculties, Principal and Management. Cultural means involving or concerning the arts with a deep sense of humor which is also a part of Cultural heritage. It involves participants from other colleges as well, so it’s also termed as inter collegiate Fest. Numbers of competitions are organized for students. Professional artist are also invited as guest or may be as judge so as to encourage more number of students to be a part of the Fest. Fests are usually funded through sponsors.


            Every student should experience being a part of College Fest at least once during the course of their undergraduate studies. And here in Anna Leela College we give equal opportunity to all the students to be a part of our Inter Collegiate Fest “VISMAYA”.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">A club is an association of people united by a common interest or goal. A service club, for example, exists for voluntary or charitable activities. There are clubs devoted to hobbies and sports, social activities clubs, political and religious clubs, and so forth.
            These are activities performed by students that fall outside the realm of classes. Such clubs may fall outside the normal curriculum of school or university education or, as in the case of subject matter clubs (e.g. student chapters of professional societies), may supplement the curriculum through informal meetings and professional mentoring.
